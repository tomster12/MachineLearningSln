# Machine Learning

Machine learning implementation in C++. Includes tensors, neural network, backpropogation, genetic algorithms, and more.

By default `install_dependencies.bat` is set to install 32-bit SFML, due to the MNIST data set in use being 32-bit.

## Build

To build first run `install_dependencies.bat` to install SFML.

This will install the **lib** and **include** directories to `dependencies/SFML`, as well as the **DLLs** into the `bin/PROJECT/PLATFORM/output/CONFIGS` folders.
